Vesa Vainio and Jorma Sajaniemi. 2007. Factors in novice programmers' poor tracing skills. In _Proceedings of the 12th annual SIGCSE conference on Innovation and technology in computer science education_ (ITiCSE '07). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 236-240.

They investigated inexperienced students' inability to trace program execution and identified some reasons.  Despite the fact that teachers often model drawing diagrams and pictures depicting program state and use this to explain and trace code, most students will not use the technique themselves.  Trying to keep track of everything in their heads is too much to keep track of and is an ineffective strategy.  Other problems they face are inability to recognize common patterns so that they can see code at a higher abstraction level, or being confused by non-idiomatic code even when they can recognize some patterns.  They suggest that these problems will go away with experience or direct instruction.  For instance, they suggest that teachers explicitly explain what elements they are depicting in their drawings, making sure students understand how and why elements are depicted, and do more to help them understand the connection between the pictures and the code.  This suggests that graphical depictions of program state in an ITS would only be effective if students understood the depictions and saw the connection to the code.
