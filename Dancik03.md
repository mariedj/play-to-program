Garrett Dancik and Amruth N. Kumar. 2003. A tutor for counter-controlled loop concepts and its evaluation. In _Proceedings of the Frontiers in Education Conference_ (FIE 2003). Boulder, CO, Session T3C.

A basic tutor that can generate random code fragments based on templates where the generated code has an output statement or statements, and the student user has to guess the output of the code fragment (as well as the number of loop iterations).  The templates that come with the tutor generate C++ count-controlled for loops.  If the student's answer is incorrect, the system can give a detailed explanation of the code fragment's execution.  To test the tutor's effectiveness, in the evaluation they conduced, the tutor administered a pre- and post-test with the use of the tutor in between.  The control group was given problems from a workbook with access to the correct answers between the tests.  The pre- and post-tests were just more template-generated loop problems from the tutor with the feedback module turned off.
