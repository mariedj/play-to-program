They used tablet software called GraphPad in a data structures course that is like a whiteboard app through which input can be recorded and annotated. It is targeted at problems with nodes and edges, where student solutions (or partial solutions) can be automatically assessed. Student input can be re-played and annotated by the instructor or the student to determine where mistakes were made or corrected. The students found the ability to re-play their own input useful, as well as the interactivity through the software with the instructor or tutoring engine. The annotating is done manually, and they are writing software to analyze this data, hoping to be able to automatically identify errors as they are made as well as to determine common mistakes made by students.<br>
