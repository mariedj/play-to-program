A study of first year CS students found them to be less comfortable with abstract concepts, found higher performing students to be more aware of what they don't know, and found some students difficulties in classifying concepts being caused by lack of familiarity with the terminology, and suggests that instructors should make more frequent use of CS terminology, especially the more abstract terms.
