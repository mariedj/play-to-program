In this paper, Kumar explains how some of the ITS features are implemented in the tutors he's helped develop in recent years.  Like a <a href='Guzman07.md'>testing system</a> developed independently from his tutors, the domain model is represented as a tree of concepts representing aggregation relationships and the student model is an overlay model on the tree.  It considers a concept known when the student has attempted at least two problems involving the concept and answered at least 60% of them correctly.  For problem selection, it selects a problem addressing a concept the student hasn't demonstrated knowledge of yet.  If a student fails to demonstrate knowledge of a concept, it will select more problems addressing it, but it will select a different problem (template) each time, and only select two or three problems in a row addressing one concept before moving on to another.  The evaluation was done in a similar manner as described in an <a href='Dancik03.md'>earlier paper</a>, but the data analysis was a bit more sophisticated.  The student model was initialized from pretest.  They found that the tutor did target concepts that students didn't understand and found learning gains, measured in both percentage and number of problems solved correctly (within a time limited post-test).  The time with the tutor was also limited, so learning gains were measured for concepts addressed during the tutoring period against ones that weren't for the same students.  They also compared two tutoring systems for loops, one using the adaptive problem selection and the other selecting concepts in a round-robin fashion, and founded that with adaptive problem selection, students learned with fewer practice problems.<br>

This paper expands on the implementation of the concept map-based domain and student models, where the leaves of the tree are learning objectives associated with the concepts in the domain model.<br>
