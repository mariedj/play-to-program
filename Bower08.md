Matt Bower. 2008. A taxonomy of task types in computing. In _Proceedings of the 13th annual conference on Innovation and technology in computer science education_ (ITiCSE '08). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 281-285.

Several attempts have been made to create a taxonomy of concepts in computer science (a few of which are cited here), but here they create a taxonomy of types of tasks that students can be asked to perform in computer science.  As usual the taxonomy goes from lower- to higher-level thinking.  This taxonomy can be helpful in making sure we are providing students proper support in the learning process and that the things we ask them to do are appropriately placed within the curriculum and appropriately sequenced.  Examples are provided to illustrate each type in the taxonomy.  The taxonomy is:

  * Declarative tasks (knowledge questions)
  * Comprehension tasks (explanation questions)
  * Debugging tasks
  * Prediction tasks
  * Provide-an-Example tasks
  * Provide-a-Model tasks ("provide an abstract representation of a situation or process")
  * Evaluate tasks (valuative judgments)
  * Meet-a-Design-Specification tasks (implement something following guidelines)
  * Solve-a-Problem tasks (design a solution themselves)
  * Self-Reflect tasks (such as metacognition)
