Michael Eagle and Tiffany Barnes. 2008. Wu's castle: teaching arrays and loops in a game. In _Proceedings of the 13th annual conference on Innovation and technology in computer science education_ (ITiCSE '08). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 245-249.

The Wu's Castle game, developed as part of an undergraduate research project, was developed to help CS1 students understand using for loops in C++ to iterate over arrays.  In the game, arrays are represented as rows of snowmen.  Students can modify parameters of loops to iterate through the arrays and change properties of the snowmen.  There is also a part for introducing students to nested loops with a path containing, literally, outer and inner loops.  The game asks students to modify loop parameters to solve particular problems, and gives them points depending on how quickly they solve them correctly.  It also asks them questions to make sure they know the purpose of each parameter.  Students liked the game, but would have liked hints when they made mistakes.  They reported significant gains in scores on array questions on a post-test for students who played the game.  The game logs information about the students' usage of the game.  They planned to add the ability for the logs to be sent to a server in the future.
