Debugging assistance for novices: a video repository.

This is a group of videos that have teachers acting out common problems found in programming. I watched a video of two teachers act as if they did not understand where a logic error was in their program and go through various probing phases to identify that the problem was with their loop index. The repository will give us areas to stress with common areas of logic blunders. What thing that could also help us is that before running their program with probes, they sort of asked each other "What should the output of this probe be?" I believe that is something we should incorporate into our system to verify what the student thinks their debugging method should display so that we know they have a grasp on the situation. After running the program with the probe, if the expected output is not what was presented, the student would have more confidence in where the logic error lies.
I have not read the entire paper yet, because its about 15 pages or watched all the videos, but I will watch all the videos pertaining to loops. If anyone else wants to see the videos they are at http://debug.csi.muohio.edu/. RD

DJW adds, one of the reasons for creating this video repository was to offer another source of help to students when they get stuck.  This underscores the need for a programming ITS to identify when and why a student is stuck (either automatically or by allowing the student to say so) and to offer help of some sort.  It may be possible to get some ideas of how to do this from these videos (there are descriptions of the initial set of videos they created in the paper).  If the student is stuck because of an error that causes a compiler error or runtime exception, it is probably easier to help them than if they are stuck because of a logic error.  The paper lists the types of problems they hoped to address, which includes both types of problems, some of which are Java-specific.  They note the forward and backward tracing strategies students use to locate bugs as well as the often-cited study that showed that students tend to trace backward from the output when debugging their own programs (and trace forward line-by-line when debugging others' programs).  They also note that better debuggers tend to be more able to articulate the high-level purpose of a section of code.  The debugging techniques they listed as being used in the videos include using print statements (for tracing flow-control and variable values), forward tracing and predicting output, tracing backward from output, using stack traces, using the debugger, commenting out code, and working in pairs.  Speaking of pair programming, they cite a bunch of previous research on its various benefits.  It may be a bit optimistic, but hopefully working with an ITS would carry at least some of those benefits (that may be a possible research area).  They used several different presentation styles for the videos that they created and intended to determine which ones were the most effective from student feedback at some point in the future.  It would be interesting to know those results if they are published.
