Jussi Kasurinen and Uolevi Nikula. 2009. Estimating programming knowledge with Bayesian knowledge tracing. In _Proceedings of the 14th annual ACM SIGCSE conference on Innovation and technology in computer science education_ (ITiCSE '09). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 313-317.

Addresses the problems of which concepts are difficult for students to learn, how well different programming structures are understood by students, and attempts to trace student learning in a programming course. They measured which concepts are difficult for students to learn by analyzing commonly made errors and they measured student understanding of programming structures by analyzing which structures were used more often. To trace student learning in the course, a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing algorithm was used. The algorithm estimates student performance by using prior knowledge and the probability to learn a concept to measure a student's learning. They used specific structures for their analysis including while vs. for loops, printing, file opening and closing, exception handlers, and functions. They found that most students had problems in the syntax of the programming, naming, and variable types. Exception handling seemed to be an area where many students had a tougher time, using logical if-else-elif's instead of the language's built-in exception handling. The paper does not go into detail about the results obtained from iteration, but does mention that some students created a custom iteration using exceptions and recursion to force valid input. RD

DJW adds, the most interesting things to take from this paper are the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing method of measuring the probability that a student understands a concept, and the idea that students tend to prefer programming structures with which they feel comfortable, even when others would result in more idiomatic code or better programming style.  It is important to note that the BKT method is more suitable for measuring the short-term acquisition of skills, rather than long-term acquisition of knowledge.
