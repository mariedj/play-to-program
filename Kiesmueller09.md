This group uses the Viterbi algorithm to develop tracking software that "records learner-system interactions differentiated by certain categories during the problem solving process." They use pattern recognition to obtain the patterns in the data. Using this they can identify a students individual problem solving strategy while using the software automatically. RD<br>

DJW adds, they hope to verify the results of their tool by conducting student interviews and then use the tool's classification of a student's problem solving strategy to give individualized and targeted feedback when errors occur.  In a previous paper, they describe their tool.  It is based on a robots-like "programming" environment where students build a program by constructing a finite automaton.  The tool tracks the students' modifications to the automaton to try to determine their problem solving strategy.  The strategies listed in the paper are "hill climbing" (solving the overall problem by solving a linear sequence of intermediate steps), "trial and error" (trying different things to see what happens, sometimes aimlessly), "top down" (determining how connecting solutions to intermediate tasks gives the overall solution first), and "bottom up" (solving intermediate tasks before determining how they connect together to give the overall solution).  It talks about the patterns of student-tool interaction that it uses to classify their problem solving strategy.  It also talks about the types of feedback messages that would be given, based on the classification of the student's strategy.  In the future they hope to investigate if there are correlations between a student's chosen problem solving strategy and things that the programming environment can measure or be aware of, such as time spent solving a problem, quality of a solution attempt, task difficulty, etc.
