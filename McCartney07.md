The strategies that students gave were categories, and examples were given. Some include being resourceful, lots of practice (self-directed exploration and structured exercises included), try to visualize the problem (draw pictures), decompose the problem and figure out what to do first, look for patterns, relate to what you already know, and be persistent. Not surprisingly, the categories of strategies match up with different learning styles. Diagnosing a student's learning styles can help figure out the best strategies for helping them. Helping students recognize their own learning style and improve their efficacy in choosing learning strategies themselves also would have value. The paper emphasizes that strategies are just as important as knowledge.<br>

They interviewed graduating students about strategies they used to become unstuck and categorized them as Input/interactions (learn from other people, get help, look up information), "Use the Force" (be persistent, willpower), Concrete/do stuff (practice, learn from examples), and Abstract/understand(relate to real world, make connections, break into parts) stuff. They're mostly study strategies that can be applied to any field and the different categories match up to the different types of learners (active, social, and creative).
