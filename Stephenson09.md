Visual examples of recursion<br>

Talks about different types of visual examples of recursion, fractals, flood fill, and maze.<br>
Fractals seemed to be the most effective and students were more interested in it.<br>
The flood fill/paint bucket algorithm was more difficult, and was more appropriate near the end of CS1.<br>
They didn't use the maze example with students but they thought it would be useful<br>
<br>
DJW adds, basically the purpose of the three examples are to help motivate the teaching of recursion and to be more appropriate and less contrived than usual examples used to introduce the topic.
