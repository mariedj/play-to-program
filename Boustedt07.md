Threshold concepts in CS: Do they exist and are they useful?<br>

The second in a series of papers investigating threshold concepts in CS, they identify OOP and pointers as threshold concepts.  Threshold concepts tend to relatively difficult and slow to fully understand, but are critical for further learning and tying together many of the ideas you learn about in some field of study.  Even if it isn't that hard to learn the low-level mechanics of the concepts, seeing the big picture, seeing how and when it is useful and being able to apply it successfully takes time and experience.  The authors argue that if computer science teachers are aware of what the threshold concepts in CS are would be beneficial.  In my own experience from learning computer science, I would call functional decomposition and object-oriented design threshold concepts.<br>

The first paper in the series.  They relate the idea of threshold concepts to other educational ideas like constructivism, mental models, misconceptions, and fundamental ideas.
