Discusses the useful and not so useful techniques students use when presented with a small programming. assignment. In the study, 22 students were split into groups of two. Using one computer the students took turns programming because they had to share the same computer. The study allowed researchers to hear students thought process because they discussed things out loud to their partner. Students were using the Java programming language and had a variety of experience with the language, but all students had at least one semester with the language. Students used different techniques to do the assigned problem including using Google, Java's API, and the textbook. (Using the textbook is believed to be more common in a two person study because one person can look up material in the book while the other focuses on the screen.) To fix bugs, students used the debugger and print statements. It was found that students that used the debugger performed to a higher level than students using the print statements or placing there error into Google. Also they did not find a relationship between students that used the debugger and their experience with the Java language. Testing was also an area studied, finding that many students did not compile often, test their code on enough test cases, or did not think about the problem before starting to code. Lastly, they found that some problems arose from confusion about the Java language and its classes.<br>

The paper gave a final synopsis that seems extremely important when implementing our system. These six bullet points that the paper mentions, I believe are necessary for a effective intelligent tutoring system:<br>
<br>
1) Encourage students to think of the problem before coding.<br>
<br>
I believe we should implement some method that forces students to think about the problem before attempting to solve it, at least in the beginning. As the user gets more advanced, maybe we can make that part optional, allowing them a more free reign over the creation of their program and hoping that they take the time to think about the problem themselves.<br>
<br>
2) Teaching students to compile often.<br>
<br>
Once again, I believe forcing the student to do this early on will help, but as the student progresses through the game/system make this a more optional task.<br>
<br>
3) Teach students how to use the debugger.<br>
<br>
Not really sure how to handle this one. Teaching the debugger might be an entirely separate task of its own.<br>
<br>
4) Demonstrate and encourage effective testing.<br>
<br>
Have the students com up with test cases as part of the assignment, submit it as well and have students test on some of them. Maybe give points for tests that make the most people crash? Just a thought, not sure how to handle that one.<br>
<br>
5) Read the API carefully.<br>
<br>
6) Highlight areas of the language that lead to confusion. RD<br>

DJW had this to say:<br>
<br>
They observed a small number of pairs of students working together on two programming problems, and took notes of the mistakes they made. Many of these mistakes were just a result of using BlueJ, instead of a real IDE which provides a lot more information and feedback (like noting and explaining syntax errors, and providing easy access to documentation). Some were a result of poor student strategies. Some students had trouble decomposing a large problem and figuring out where to start. Most did a poor job of testing their code. A tutor encourage students to test their code more carefully, or could provide more test cases to point out likely problems students may miss (mainly to underscore the importance and to model the testing process), as well as diagnose misconceptions by the way students structure their code, and provide them feedback to help them address these misconceptions. Many of the students demonstrated poor knowledge of Java, and had poor strategies for rectifying this.
