A group of experts attempted to create a list of important and difficult topics for early CS courses that could be used for creating reliable assessment tools (especially for evaluating the effectiveness of experimental methods, tools, or teaching practices).  They discuss the process they used to create their lists.  The experts came from universities that use different languages and paradigms for their intro programming course, so perhaps a better list could be created by a group of instructors that agree on the curriculum being addressed.  Nevertheless, the list compiled for intro programming contained the following items:<br>
<br>
<ul><li>local vs. global scope<br>
</li><li>parameter scope<br>
</li><li>memory model, including references/pointers<br>
</li><li>procedure design<br>
</li><li>functional decomposition<br>
</li><li>abstraction, pattern recognition and use<br>
</li><li>designing problem solutions<br>
</li><li>debugging<br>
</li><li>designing tests<br>
</li><li>recursion<br>
