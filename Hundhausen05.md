In the CS1 course at Wazzou, they focus on problem solving and algorithm development at the beginning of the semester.  In two labs early in the semester, they have students work in pairs on an algorithm problem, develop the algorithm (in psuedocode), and develop a visualization and a story to go along with it.  Then each student group presents their visualization and story to the class.  In one semester, they had students develop their algorithm without any tool support and develop their visualization using art supplies and transparencies.  In another semester they had their students use a tool that supports their pseudocode format and assists in the creation of the visualization and visual elements of the story.  The tool was very easy to use, which is important, because in algorithms when they had their students create visualizations using a more complicated tool, their presentations got mired down in "war stories" about the development process.  Videotaping the entire labs, they did a comparison of the process the students went through to create their presentations and the qualities of what they created.  They found that the tool support allowed students to be more productive, confident, independent, and effective during the development of their algorithms.  Then, given that they had more time and further tool support, their visualizations were more advanced in terms of visual qualities and storytelling components.  Finally, they found the student presentations with the tool group to be more engaging.  Also, students not using the tools could hand-wave over and hide parts of their algorithm they knew to be incorrect, while students using the tool had no choice but to have these flaws exposed, which led to discussions of how to fix those flaws.  However, students not in the tool group's verbal descriptions of their algorithms tended to be at a higher level.  They noted that the educational effectiveness of this activity needs further investigation.  They also noted that the facilitator of the activity plays an important role in audience participation during the presentations.
