Commonsense computing: using student sorting abilities to improve instruction<br>

The second in a series of studies of how students approach various fundamental algorithms problems before they learn them formally, they compared their students' approach to sorting dates to their previous students' (from the first study) approach to sorting numbers.  They found the previous students focused more on lower-level details, while the current students gave a higher-level description of their approach and treated sorting numbers as an assumed primitive operation.  They noted that their students' concepts of data types and representation were not well developed, agreeing with my experience that direct instruction about this is necessary with new programmers.  They did find that most students could give a reasonable algorithm, as well breaking the date sorting task into subtasks.  They suggest that instructors should try to leverage this ability and just try to focus on teaching students how to translate these ideas into a programming language, as well as translating their mental model of computation and storage to that used by computers.<br>

The first study in the series; the number sorting task.  They noted that most students were able to give a reasonable algorithm, treated numbers as strings, and used 'until' to express iteration more often than they used 'while.'
