This group uses nearly the same taxonomy as <a href='AlBarakati09.md'>this paper</a> for student engagement with algorithms: No Viewing, Viewing, Changing, Constructing, and Presenting. They eliminated responding (i.e. to questions) from the engagement taxonomy.<br>
They used a tool called Alvie that is an anthropomorphised algorithm visualisation environment, that runs through pseudocode illustrating what is happening. According to the authors, the students enjoyed the activities and, in a survey, said they helped. I'm not certain that very much of interest to the game was in this paper, unless it gets much more sophisticated tools. EF<br>

DJW adds, they used the Alvie tool in a data structures course and asked students to view, change, create, and present data-structure algorithm visualizations.  The course has an associated textbook that refers to the tool and the visualizations.
