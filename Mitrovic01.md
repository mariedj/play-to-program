Michael Mayo, and Antonija Mitrovic. 2001. Optimising ITS behaviour with Bayesian networks and decision theory. _International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education_, 12, 2, 124-153.

In first part of this paper, they review the use of Bayesian networks for student modeling in intelligent tutoring systems, identifying the uses as expert-centric where the authors set the structure and probabilities of the Bayesian network in advance, or efficiency-centric where the authors set the structure and the probabilities are learned by the system.  They then introduce their data-centric idea, where both the structure and probabilities are learned by the system.  After that they talk about how Bayesian network-based student models are used to select the next action by the system (in terms of problem selection and feedback).  They described as "alternative strategies" systems that use a heuristic to select the next action, noting the reasons this strategy is employed (efficiency), problems with the strategy (selecting a suboptimal action), and a case where the heuristic was based on Vigotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (SQL-Tutor) where a system did tend to select problems of the appropriate level of difficulty.  They described diagnostic strategies that are designed to select actions (problems) that will maximize the reduction of uncertainty in the student model, which are most applicable to testing systems.  Finally, they described their approach based on decision theory, whose goal is to select an optimal action in terms of maximizing a pedagogical utility function which includes many factors (including reducing uncertainty and selecting a problem of appropriate difficulty).

The rest of the paper describes how they implemented their data-centric decision-theoretic strategies in a system for teaching young students capitalization rules.  The process consists of data collection, model generation, implementation of the decision-theoretic strategy (including designing the utility function), on-line adaptation, and evaluation.  In the system they describe, the structure of the Bayesian network is defined during the model generation step, and only the probabilities are updated during the on-line adaptation.  Theoretically both could be adapted over time, but this would be more difficult.  The resulting system was evaluated against a version of the system that performed random action selection, which was also used during the data collection step of building the newer version of the system.

The student model in their system is based on constraint-based modeling.  They noted that for the domain of their system, the constraints are mostly independent.  Their data showed that a constraint that was satisfied correctly by the student was 91% likely to be satisfied again on the next attempt.  They also noted that a small Bayesian network is effective and appropriate for such a domain.  They hypothesized that a larger Bayesian network would be needed for good predictive performance in a domain where the constraints (or whatever's being modeled) are more interdependent.  They also note that there could be some scalability problems when applying their design strategy to a domain with a large number of constraints (or whatever's being modeled) and suggest some possible solutions to that.  They also talk a little bit about the domain appropriateness of constraint-based modeling vs. student models based on other things like concepts or problem-solving strategies.
