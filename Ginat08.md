This paper discusses the fact that errors in logic and faulty problem solving techniques can double as powerful opportunities for learning. It advocates the strategy of guiding students through a dynamically improving progression of better and better algorithms to solve problems, helping them tap their creativity and critical skills to conquer difficult algorithmic tasks rather than presenting a stiff and formal model. It advocates stepping thropugh solutions, finding falsifying examples, and then finding new solution models.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the stiff and formal 'correct solutions' it refers to are more relevant to an introductory algorithms course than in an introduction to Python as a CS1 course; perhaps not. One of the most valuable things in this paper is the myriad of cognitive problem solving strategies and errors it identifies - recurring patterns that students tend to fall into - and how excercises were specifically chosen to identify and highlight these patterns, reinforcing the good and whittling away the bad.<br>
<br>
The idea of selecting and designing problems to highlight and mold cognitive processes - having a pattern of problem to teach a pattern of ideas - could be especially valuable to the system. Providing feedback on the type of mistake made and then generating a novel yet analogous problem until the strategy has been absorbed would be a potentially helpful feature. EF<br>

DJW adds, generally in algorithms courses, exercises are paired with the method that should be used to solve them.  Ginat models a more realistic problem solving process with his students where he presents problems out of context and solicits solutions from the students.  They work from faulty solution strategies, and students have to find and classify inputs that don't work and suggest changes to the solution until they find one that works.  This process engages students every step of the way and provides more realistic practice for solving algorithms problems.<br>

Hasty design, futile patching and the elaboration of rigor<br>

Earlier paper by Ginat about how algorithms students tend to use local patching rather than questioning their design strategy when their algorithms don't work.  He examines some of the reasons that this happens and presents some examples.  He suggests some ways to help students stop making these mistakes, including making them aware of them, as well as advocating rigorous testing.
