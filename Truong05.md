Nghi Truong, Paul Roe, and Peter Bancroft. 2005. Automated feedback for "fill in the gap" programming exercises. In _Proceedings of the 7th Australasian conference on Computing education - Volume 42_ (ACE '05), Alison Young and Denise Tolhurst (Eds.), Vol. 42.

This paper talks about a system they created where the programming exercises come with skeleton code, and the students only have to fill in certain pieces.  The system then evaluates the student code by running the program and examining the effect of the student's code blocks that they filled in.  It can compare to a model solution the console output produced or the changes in the values of the variables.  In doing so, it can narrow down where the logic errors are in a program, and provide appropriate feedback, which is written ahead of time by the instructor (as are the model solution and test data).

This paper brings to light the many different ways for analyzing student programs and diagnosing errors.  The approach used in this paper is dynamic analysis performed by executing the program.  The authors also have written another paper about how their system also does some static analysis on the code.  They mention other related work where systems have taken other approaches, such as using code introspection (using Java's reflection capabilities) to analyze and instrument the code.  Semantic analysis of code is another possibility.  Different types of analysis also can analyze different aspects of a program.  The dynamic analysis described in this paper only deals with correctness of the programs.  Other types of analysis could examine coding style.  For something like RUR-PLE, the behavior of the program isn't defined by console output, but by how the program affects the robot environment.  Runtime analysis could be performed by monitoring that interface as well.

This is the paper where talk about the static analysis performed by their system.  It parses the student code and model solution(s) into abstract syntax trees and compares their structure.  It also looks for common poor programming practices and logic errors.
