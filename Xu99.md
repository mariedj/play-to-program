A student program is checked against a model solution by transforming both into a dependence graph so that they can be compared semantically.  Semantics-preserving transformations are applied to improve the comparison.  Errors in student programs can be identified, indications of corrections needed can be provided, and programs can also be checked for correctness.  These techniques are implemented in a Smalltalk programming learning environment.  The paper lists the semantics-preserving variations that are supported, explains the program to graph transformation process, and how each type of variation is handled.<br>
