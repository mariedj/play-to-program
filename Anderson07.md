DJW adds, The authors argue that instructors should have a clearly defined purpose when integrating technology into the classroom.  One of the authors teaches an algorithms course and uses Tablet PCs.  They follow one common usage of distributing the lecture slides to the students' tablets.  One day a week they solve problems in class to give students some guided practice.  The efficiency with which the instructor can collect, review, and display to the class, students' digitally submitted solutions is cited as a major benefit of using the technology.  The paper describes a few type of class activities (with examples) in which they take advantage of this in order to encourage participation and active learning and provide support for future discussion and students' independent practice.
