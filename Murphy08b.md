The Backstop tool provides a text trace of a program, showing all state (variable) changes along with the lines of code and values that caused them (notably different from a debugger where you can only see one change at a time).  It also provides English explanations (in a friendly tone) of runtime exceptions and their causes.  Their evaluation of the tool with a small number of students provided mixed results.  It seemed that the exception explanations were a bit verbose and that the program trace was helpful in fixing a logical error.
