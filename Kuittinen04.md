This paper promotes the idea of teaching roles of variables as a design strategy. It presents ten variables roles that cover most use cases in novice-level programs, and suggests strategies for teaching these roles. They studied the effectiveness of this in conjunction with software that animates and visualizes these roles. They note that visualizations must be explained to be understood. They also note that software can automatically determine the role of a variable in a program by examining how the variable is assigned its value(s). Sajaniemi wrote about a web-based service that does just that in a more recent paper.

A later study suggested that understanding roles helps with program comprehension and that experience with PlanAni also helps with program construction, but the study groups were too small for any statistical significance.
