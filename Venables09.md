Anne Venables, Grace Tan, and Raymond Lister. 2009. A closer look at tracing, explaining and code writing skills in the novice programmer. In _Proceedings of the fifth international workshop on Computing education research workshop_ (ICER '09). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 117-128.

Another in a [series](Lister09.md) of similar studies, it supports the conclusions of the other studies that code tracing and explaining skills are good predictors of, and probably prerequisites for, success in writing code for novice programmers, and also that the degree to which specific tracing or explaining tasks are a good predictor depends heavily on the construction and wording of such tasks.  The notable thing about this study is that when linear regressions did not yield strong correlations for the relationships they were looking for, they used chi-square tests to show that the relationships do exist, but they just aren't linear, it's more of a threshold effect.
