A study of the development of students' visualizations of program state during an elementary object-oriented programming course<br>

The goal of this study is not clear.  At three points during the semester they asked students to draw a diagram depicting the state and execution of an object-oriented program, and then they analyzed these drawings, hoping to gain insight into students' understanding of OO concepts.  They used two visualization tools during the semester (PlanAni and Jeliot) and they also tried to determine the tools' effect on students drawings.  They noted that students drawings don't necessarily reflect those used by their teachers or the tools, but the degree to which the tools did influence their drawings was mostly correlated with which tool they had used most recently (which is not surprising).  Due to a lack of clear goals, the study did not have any strong conclusions.  All that stood out to me is how students seemed to forget the main method's role in program state the farther along they went (as they got farther from being taught strictly in the imperative paradigm I guess).  The study does raise the question of whether students really understand the pictures of program state we CS teachers often draw while tracing the execution of example code.  They also noted how students tend to be reluctant to draw such pictures for themselves in general, which agrees with my experience from teaching.
