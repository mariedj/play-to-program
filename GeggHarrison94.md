His automated debugger for Prolog programs works by transforming student and model solutions to a normal form (which is still a Prolog program) and then first comparing them to determine the algorithm the student used to solve the problem, and then to locate the bug.  Then a buggy rules are used to determine the cause of the bug so that feedback can be offered.  The ability of the system to formally classify the types of problems it can handle is listed as a unique feature.
