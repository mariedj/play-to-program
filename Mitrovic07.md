Overview of the Constraint-Based Modeling (CBM) approach to student modeling in Intelligent Tutoring Systems that was developed by the authors.  CBM is an alternative to model-tracing that is easier to develop and more suitable to domains with open-ended problem solving procedures, such as programming.  This paper also talks about some authoring tools for CBM-based tutors developed by the authors.
