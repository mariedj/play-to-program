Eduardo Guzmán, Ricardo Conejo, and José-Luis Pérez-de-la-Cruz. 2007. Adaptive testing for hierarchical student models. _User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction_ 17, 1-2 (March 2007), 119-157.

In this paper, they propose a methodology for building an intelligent testing system, designed to assess students' knowledge of concepts being tested by using multiple-choice tests.  In their proposal, the concept map is restricted to a tree, knowledge levels are discretized, and the student model is an overlay model on the tree.  The tree represents aggregation relationships between related concepts and sub-concepts.  For the test questions used, it considers the probability of choosing each answer choice (rather than just correct vs. incorrect) at each knowledge level, which allows students' knowledge levels to be accurate estimated with a minimal number of questions.  They propose using kernel smoothing to calibrate the questions without needing thousands of prior tests.  Their proposal also includes an efficient method for problem selection based on expected information gain.  Basically the point is to allow the construction of a testing system with feasible practicality, providing accurate diagnosis without putting an unreasonable burden on either instructors or students.
