Surprisingly, someone (in France) is still trying to teach novice programmers the idea of formal program verification (an idea that came to be known as not generally applicable after the 1970s, but was still taught in graduate level programming language design courses as recently as the mid-1990s) using Axiomatic Semantics.  Since it isn't possible to do this with real programming languages, they use a restricted language called Oz.  The students used to have to do the verification proofs by hand, which obviously didn't go over very well.  The authors created a tool to automate the proof process once a program and formal specifications are given.  It doesn't appear that the tool gives any information about the details or steps of the proof as I've seen in another tool somewhere, so the students' focus is on the program and the specification.  The tool with either verify that they are a match, or not, and provide a counterexample that highlights the mismatch.  I'm not sure what they hope for students to gain from this, and it doesn't appear they are either.  The ability of the tool to find counterexamples is interesting, and is something I haven't seen before.  Unfortunately, the paper doesn't say how the tool finds them.  It is possible that it just tries "everything," as it says in the paper that you have to restrict the input domain for it to really work.
