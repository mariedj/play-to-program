I have only read the abstract so far, but this paper could prove to be helpful. It addresses how a student reacts to error messages and found that more details about a certain error do not necessarily simplify the understanding of an error, but it matters more how and where the information is displayed.

DJW adds, in this study, they found the visual presentation of compiler errors in BlueJ and the verbose compiler error messages in EiffelStudio to not be particularly effective with novice programmers.  This just highlights the need for tools (especially for complicated languages like Java where a lot can go wrong) to do a good job helping students locate and fix errors.  I would imagine Eclipse would have been a lot more effective had it been used in this study.
