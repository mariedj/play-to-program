The authors have written a series of papers about their development of an ITS for linked lists talking about the research behind it, the development process, and evaluations and explanations of some of the newer features they've developed.  In this paper, after having implemented enough of the system to run it, they give an overview of the system, the design philosophy, and work to be done.  The system is interesting for several reasons, including its visualizations, its natural language feedback system (mostly yet to be developed, as of this paper), and its use of constraint-based modeling which has been <a href='Mitrovic07.md'>previously</a> argued to be the best choice for diagnosis in a programming domain.  As of this paper, the student model hadn't been implemented, so it wasn't a full ITS yet.  Nevertheless, an evaluation of the system already showed learning gains.  The findings (including other papers) about feedback show that it's important for feedback to be clear, brief, and often positive to be most effective, and those findings are influencing their development of that part of the system.<br>

A newer paper that discusses the development of the feedback system.  As of this paper they have made the feedback for syntax and runtime errors more sophisticated.  They discuss several evaluations they have done with the system.  They also discuss the research they have done into human tutoring and how that will influence future development of the feedback system, including shifting more toward positive and proactive feedback (based on comparing a student's actions with logs of previous students who have used the system).<br>

A newer paper that discusses further development of the feedback system, based on the idea presented at the end of the previous paper.  To review, constraint-based modeling is used for diagnosis of the end result of the student's solution.  It doesn't offer any information about the process the student goes through to create that solution or the process the student's solution goes through to achieve the end result.  To do some intermediate diagnosis on the latter, the system builds a model of state changes (to the list nodes) that students solutions in the past have made.  Using that model, from any intermediate state, it can determine the probability of a solution causing any possible state change, and the possibility that a possible state change will lead to a correct solution.  This allows the system to offer proactive feedback, as well as offering positive feedback when a student's solution is on track but the system detects that the student is uncertain about their progress.  Uncertainty is based the actions the student performs and how long it takes them to perform them.  They evaluate the new feature and reveal their plan to add even more proactive feedback in the future, in the form of questioning such as a human tutor or teacher would do.
