AtoL classifies a student into one of three models, challenge, regular, and reinforcement. The challenge model is the student being constantly challenged and learning from their own mistakes, the reinforcement model gives the student repeated reinforcement to understand a topic, and the regular model is a combination of the two. Students are placed in these groups passed on teacher finding and student perception via a survey. Once in a particular group, a more refined cluster is formed using a strategy adjustment model. Lastlly, an adaptive poriton is used, based off a students past performances and the tutor selects an appropriate strategy. The experiment was conducted by splitting each lab into two groups, one using AtoL, and one using their old lab method. A pretest and post-test was given for each lab. With a sample size of greater than fifty for each group in each lab, they found that one the post-test were much better than the pretest, meaning the labs were worthwhile, and more importantly that the post-test scores for students using AtoL was significanlty higher than the students using the old lab method. Another key observation was that the completion rate of the lab was much higher when the student was using the AtoL system. The program also determined discrepancies between a teachers dificulty rating of a problem and a students. A survey conducted on students also showed that they found the AtoL lab setting to be much better than the old lab setting.

Multiple choice, true or false, and short answer question types are used. RD

DJW adds, they developed a relatively full-featured ITS that includes two types of tutors, a question/answer tutor and a programming tutor.  They found it to be effective in helping students learn when used in a lab environment.  One unique feature is the tree of concepts which it shows to the user, including the system's assessment of the student's level of understanding at each node.
