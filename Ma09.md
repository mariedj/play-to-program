This paper suggests a process for addressing students' conceptual misconceptions of basic programming concepts, which includes showing them visualizations of executing code. They reported varying levels of success of their process with different concepts. The paper also includes a concept map of basic programming concepts, which interestingly, one of their tools not only uses internally, but it also shows it directly to students, including showing them which ones the tool believes they have or have not mastered. An expanded version of the paper includes descriptions of common student misconceptions ("inappropriate mental models") for these concepts. Their results underscored the need for visualizations to be simple if they are to be effective.

SUMMARY: Compared a more complex visualization (the Jeliot tool)<br>
and found that students may do better with a simpler visualization<br>
that focuses on problematic concepts. Also provides a "concepts<br>
roadmap" that might be useful for us.<br>
<br>
<ul><li>same approach as previous study;<br>
<blockquote>o - "concepts roadmap" - "ordered approach to learning programming concepts" - maybe this would be useful for us as a starting point? (see Fig. 1 in paper - 16 concepts in partial order, with student understanding marked visually)<br>
</blockquote></li><li>each concept is associated with some exercises (where students have to "mentally execute a program fragment and predict the result")<br>
</li><li>Jeliot visualization tool as visualization component - that's just the name of a particular tool for Java program visualization (no info is given in the paper, but the authors cite a tech report) <a href='http://cs.joensuu.fi/jeliot/index.php'>http://cs.joensuu.fi/jeliot/index.php</a>
<blockquote>o Jeliot visualization shows everything, not just relevant concepts<br>
o the "home-made" visualization that simplified to just focus on the concepts being learned seemed to be more effective<br>
</blockquote></li><li>Jeliot vis. of object reference was too complex for CS1 students<br>
</li><li>after study, students still had difficulty with "conditionals, loops, scope, parameter passing and object reference"</li></ul>

SUMMARY: Showing students where they've gone wrong, along with various<br>
ways to illustrate the correct answer (visualization, "cognitive<br>
conflict," text descriptions) can help them to form better mental<br>
models.<br>
<br>
<ul><li>no new or novel visualization techniques were introduced<br>
</li><li>"poor problem-solving ability is... the main cause of failure in programming learning"<br>
</li><li>"non-viable mental models of key programming concepts" - specifically (in this work) value assignment and object reference<br>
</li><li>approach: "constructivist-based teaching model" - "cognitive conflict strategy" and program visualization<br>
</li><li>cognitive conflict - identify what students are thinking and show counterexamples that will challenge their mental model<br>
</li><li>value assignment: visualization or vis-plus-cog-conflict results in correct mental model<br>
</li><li>object reference assignment: vis-plus-cog-conflict improves performance vs. vis alone (but many students still didn't learn the concept properly)<br>
</li><li>web-based learning environment<br>
</li><li>ask students to make predictions (based on programs that are designed to trigger inappropriate mental models that students typically hold)<br>
</li><li>then show a visualization of the program executing, along with textual explanations<br>
</li><li>in their experiments, "cognitive conflict" just means that students were told that they answered a test question incorrectly. not exactly a radical conflict!
