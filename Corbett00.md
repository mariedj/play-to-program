These papers discuss a few experiments conducted with the often-cited model-tracing ACT Lisp tutor.  The tutor has been criticized for how constrained it is (by <a href='Ramadhan00.md'>Ramadhan</a> and others), given the way it attempts to correct the student as they enter their program on a symbol by symbol basis.  The second paper tried delaying the feedback in various ways and found it to still be as effective, while taking longer for students to complete programs.  Various other students have found advantages in delaying feedback.  In the first paper, they found that adding some animations to help students understand the structure of lists being put together increased post test scores, while guiding the student through solving a problem by establishing subgoals decreased the time to reach mastery in the tutor, but again, provided no increase in effectiveness (as measured on a post test).<br>

The implication is that the whole model-tracing paradigm applied to programming requires a substantial effort to create the tutor, while offering only reduced time to mastery in the tutor as the only measurable advantage.  Another system, <a href='Ramadhan00.md'>Discover</a>, also uses model-tracing, although on a line-by-line basis rather than symbol.  In the Discover paper, Ramadhan brings up an important point.  These types of systems force students to write the program in a linear fashion, which while it is a common strategy for novice programmers, the question needs to be asked whether this is the model we want to be teaching students.  Even in the first paper here where they introduced subgoal construction through the top-down design strategy, they still only achieved reduced tutor time but no increase in effectiveness.  The amount of time and effort spent offering feedback during the programming process, and the nature of this feedback, needs to be weighed against the goals of a tutor when it is being designed.
