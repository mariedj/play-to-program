This paper confirmed things that we already know such as starting projects late correlates to lower grades.  One thing interesting about this paper was in a survey 92% of students believed they compiled their code frequently and fixed errors before continuing their development.  This does not correlate with what many faculty members believed, 25% in this case, proving that their is a misunderstanding between students in faculty about how much compiling is considered frequent.  Something that is also interesting in the same survey 80% of students believed they tested code thoroughly and 80% believed they wrote modular, organized code.  This differs enormously from the respective 8% and 17% of faculty members that agree with the statements.

Part of the survey that I believe would be helpful in our studies is some type of comparison between students.  74% of students and 84% of faculty members believed that knowing how a student's habits compared with other students in the class would help them. A feature such as this may have an impact of making assignments more competitive.  I'm not sure if that is necessarily a good thing, but it may drive some students to perform better. RD

DJW had this to say:

They studied how students spend their time in BlueJ by tracking events in the IDE including compilations (and whether they had errors or not). The most interesting result was that unsuccessful students spend just as much time working on the assignments as successful students, so they obviously just aren't using the time as productively.
