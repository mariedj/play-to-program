Two parts. First part gives a fairly in-depth of analysis of SRec as a visual tool for recursion, Java only.<br>
Second part discusses a study where SRec was used to debug a recursive algorithm.<br>
Conclusion that was reached. SRec is fairly weak as a debugging tool, however, as debugging isn't SRec's primary purpose this was seen as inconsequential. Another thing to note, is that SRec did exceedingly well at it's primary purpose to help analyze how a working recursive algorithm performed.<br>

DJW adds, SRec is a visualization and animation program for recursive algorithms.  It shows a temporal trace, call stack, and recursion tree, and can show input and output parameters as well as data structures.  In the second paper, they added additional features for mutual recursive and divide-and-conquer algorithms.
