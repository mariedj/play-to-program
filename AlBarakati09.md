Nouf M. Al-Barakati and Arwa Y. Al-Aama. 2009. The effect of visualizing roles of variables on student performance in an introductory programming course. In _Proceedings of the 14th annual ACM SIGCSE conference on Innovation and technology in computer science education_ (ITiCSE '09). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 228-232.

This paper finds that using the PlanAni (role of variables visualization) tool from the [Sajaniemi paper](Kuittinen04.md) has no significant effect on students' performance on a post-test. They suggest that visualizations should allow for rewinding and check for understanding throughout (not just after).

EF had this to say:

The authors exposed students to the same traditional materiel, and then to various visualisations. They found that visualizing the role of the variable led to increases in debugging, but no other skills.

They divide the variable roles encounteded in introductory CS classes into nine roles:
  * Fixed Value (a constant),
  * Stepper(for example, i++),
  * Follower(takes its value from another variable),
  * Most-recent holder(holds last input read),
  * Most-wanted holder(holds best value read),
  * Gatherer(accumulates...stuff),
  * One-way flag(boolean),
  * Organiser(an array to be sorted),
  * Temporary.
They also divide visualizations into No viewing, Viewing, Responding, Changing, Constructing, and Presenting, the idea being that the greater the level of engagement, the better the learning.

The conclusions of the writers of this paper did not seem very enlightening; despite finding virtually no difference between the students who engaged in some way with the visualisation tool and those who did their primary suggestions seemed to be to improve the technology they spent the paper denouncing. It was not a very cut-your-losses approach.

At any rate, I think the taxonomy they used, if not their results, is interesting and helpful. The idea of visualising different sorts of variables as different things according to their functions is a useful one. And keeping as a goal maximum student engagement on the hierarchy presented above is a good idea. The environment now does not incorporate variales to a large extent, but perhaps they could be incorporated to help novice programmers better grasp their roles. EF
