A former chief reader for the APCS exam did a statistical analysis on the 1988 exam question for correlations.  He found that the questions that correlated most highly to success on the rest of the question involved reading code and understanding what it does.  He also suggests that changing of program state is an important component to these questions.  He cites earlier research that students' mental models of computation are very important in all of the skills we want intro CS students to acquire.  He also says that students that have an opportunity to practice these types of problems tend to do well on them.  This seems to be a pretty good argument for giving students more of an opportunity to practice these types of problems.
