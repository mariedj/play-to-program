Amruth N. Kumar. 2005. Results from the evaluation of the effectiveness of an online tutor on expression evaluation. In _Proceedings of the 36th SIGCSE technical symposium on Computer science education_ (SIGCSE '05). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 216-220.

The author developed an intelligent tutoring system focusing on expression evaluation for introductory CS.  The types of feedback it offers the student are whether their answer is correct, what the correct answer is, a step-by-step evaluation to show how the answer is calculated (just showing which parts of the expression are evaluated and what their values are), and a textual explanation of each step in the evaluation.  They did a study which showed that using the tutor is more effective than a workbook (that includes problems with their answers in the back), and that showing the step-by-step evaluation is more effective than just showing the answer, and finally that giving the textual explanation is more effective than just showing the step-by-step evaluation.  They compare this to results in other studies that visualizations need to be explained to be most effective.  This suggests that a programming tutor that asks a student to predict the behavior of a program and then allows them to see if they are correct will be more effective the more information it gives them to see why it behaves the way it does.  So not only should it show step-by-step execution, but include brief explanations of what each step is doing.  Features to be added after the publication of the paper include changing problem generation from totally random to template-based, with the templates indexed by learning outcomes, which helps the system learn what the user has mastered, so that it can use adaptive problem generation.  The paper cites a whole slew of other programming tutors, including several others the author was involved with.  This paper's [references](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1047422) are worth further investigation.
