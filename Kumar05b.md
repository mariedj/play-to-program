Amruth N. Kumar. 2005. Generation of problems, answers, grade, and feedback---case study of a fully automated tutor. _J. Educ. Resour._ Comput (JERIC). 5, 3, Article 3 (September 2005).

Kumar defines several ways to classify tutoring systems, including what purpose they were designed for and how they interact with the user, what stage of Bloom's taxonomy they address, what types of problems they can generate and solve, and how and what kind of feedback they present to the user.  Kumar presents a flexibility spectrum for generation of problems, answers, and feedback, grading criteria, and feedback content.  Kumar also classifies several existing CS tutoring systems according to these criteria.  Kumar has helped develop several of these tutoring systems, including one about scope for a programming languages course that is covered in more depth in this paper.  The design and implementation of that system is explained, including its grading system.  It explains how it assess and grades each problem and how it assesses the student's knowledge level using an overlay model.  An evaluation of the system is also described, and it was found that significant learning gains are achieved when the system gives detailed feedback to students about why their answers are incorrect.

Most interesting of the spectra presented are those for problem generation and feedback content.  Problems can be a static set provided by an instructor, generated from templates, generated more randomly, or even provided at runtime by users (students).  Kumar believes template-based generation is best when the concept being addressed is more related to the semantics of programs, and that the more random approach is better when focusing more on syntax.  [One tutor developed by Kumar](Kumar05a.md) on expression evaluation was planned to move from random generation to template-based generation in accordance with this, while the scope tutor uses random generation.  Feedback can be simply correctness, explanation of how to reach the correct answer, explanation of why a user's answer is incorrect, and explanation of how a user can correct their incorrect answer.
