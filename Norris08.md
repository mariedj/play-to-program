ClockIt is an IDE plugin that monitors a student's activity including editing and saving code, compiling code and compilation errors, and running and testing the programs.  It compiles the data and sends it to a centralized server.  Students can see the statistics about their own individual usage, and instructors can look at statistics for individuals or the entire class.  The goal of the ClockIt developers is to determine how usage patterns differ between successful and unsuccessful students (as well as how they differ from current perceptions), to try to give instructors insight and allow them to be more able to help students with the development process.
