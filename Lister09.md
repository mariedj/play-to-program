Raymond Lister, Colin Fidge, and Donna Teague. 2009. Further evidence of a relationship between explaining, tracing and writing skills in introductory programming. In _Proceedings of the 14th annual ACM SIGCSE conference on Innovation and technology in computer science education_ (ITiCSE '09). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 161-165.

One in a series of studies showing the correlation between CS1 students' ability to trace code, explain code, and write code. Study used a different university and programming language (Python) than had been used previously. Examples of the test questions they used to assess these skills are given in the paper. This study underscores the importance of not just asking students to write code, but also to interpret already written code. The study also notes how these skills develop in parallel, rather than being acquired in sequence. Note the unique ability of a visual programming environment to provide students with written code, ask them what it does, and then play it for them so they can see if they were correct, and why or why not. Additionally, the authors note that it is important that students use their tracing and explaining skills in correcting errors in their own code. This provides a hint of how to help students do this (as the alternative strategy is modifying their code "haphazardly").
