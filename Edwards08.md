Rather than being an article, this page highlights some of the features of Web-CAT (Web-based Center for Automated Testing), a customizable open-source project hosted on Sourceforge, that 'is famous for grading students on how well they test their own code,' apparently meant to be used in conjuction with assignments involving software test. According to the website's FAQ (<a href='http://web-cat.org/WCWiki/WebCatFaq'>http://web-cat.org/WCWiki/WebCatFaq</a>) students turn in better code that they have more confidence earlier in when they do their own testing. It uses other resources like PMD (pmd.sourceforge.net/) and Checkstyle (checkstyle.sourceforge.net) to facilitate its grading.<br>
It seems relevant inasmuch as it confirms that instant, detailed feedback increases student confidence. It is unclear whether there are parts of their grading strategy that would be relevant and useful. EF<br>

DJW adds, according to the short paper (there was a live demonstration at the conference), what's notable about this system is that students have to submit their own tests along with their program.
